# Optimizing Email Campaign Open Rates: A/B Testing Subject Line and Preheader Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted on email campaign subject lines and preheaders to determine the most effective combination for maximizing open rates. The analysis leverages Python data analysis and visualization libraries to identify statistically significant differences in open rates across various subject line and preheader variations.  The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving future email marketing campaigns and boosting customer engagement.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the A/B test results to the console, including:

*  Overall open rates for each subject line/preheader combination.
*  Statistical significance tests (e.g., Chi-squared test) comparing different variations.
*  Key findings and recommendations.

Additionally, the script will generate the following visualization:

*   `open_rate_comparison.png`: A bar chart visualizing the open rates for each A/B tested subject line and preheader combination, highlighting the most effective ones.


This analysis helps to inform future email marketing strategies by providing data-driven insights into the impact of subject lines and preheaders on email open rates.
